BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.
LUCENTIO:
Hearest thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.
LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be so contented:
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.
KATHARINA:
I know it is the moon.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharina.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
HORTENSIO:
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
KATHARINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.
VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?
VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, gentle sir.
PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?
HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.
BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
Pedant:
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Pedant:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?
Pedant:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
Pedant:
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.
VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?
Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
PETRUCHIO:
Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
VINCENTIO:
BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.
VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.
VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?
BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.
VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed.
BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.
TRANIO:
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.
TRANIO:
How now! what's the matter?
BAPTISTA:
What, is the man lunatic?
TRANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
VINCENTIO:
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?
VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.
Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!
GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.
Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.
GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.
TRANIO:
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!
BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.
LUCENTIO:
VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?
BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.
BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?
LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
GREMIO:
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?
BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.
BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?
VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
LUCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
KATHARINA:
What, in the midst of the street?
PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?
KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.
LUCENTIO:
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HORTENSIO:
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.
KATHARINA:
Mistress, how mean you that?
Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.
PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now you know my meaning,
KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.
Widow:
Right, I mean you.
KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!
HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!
PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
HORTENSIO:
That's my office.
PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
TRANIO:
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for his master.
PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?
LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.
PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.
LUCENTIO:
A hundred then.
HORTENSIO:
Content.
PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.
HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?
LUCENTIO:
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
BIONDELLO:
I go.
BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
LUCENTIO:
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
How now! what news?
BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.
PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?
GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.
HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.
PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.
HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife?
BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.
PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I command her to come to me.
HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.
PETRUCHIO:
What?
HORTENSIO:
She will not.
PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
Widow:
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Widow:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
Widow:
She shall not.
PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.
KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!
HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
Master:
Boatswain!
Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?
Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!
ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.
Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.
ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?
Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.
GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.
Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.
GONZALO:
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!
Boatswain:
Work you then.
ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
GONZALO:
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.
Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.
Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?
GONZALO:
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.
SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.
ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.
ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the king.
SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of him.
GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.
MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.
PROSPERO:
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.
MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!
PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.
MIRANDA:
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.
MIRANDA:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
PROSPERO:
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.
MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.
PROSPERO:
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?
PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.
MIRANDA:
But that I do not.
PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.
MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?
PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?
PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.
MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?
MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.
PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.
PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou hear?
MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.
MIRANDA:
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.
PROSPERO:
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.
MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.
MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!
PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.
MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?
PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.
MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see that man!
PROSPERO:
Now I arise:
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?
PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.
ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.
PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.
PROSPERO:
